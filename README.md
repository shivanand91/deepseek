# DeepSeek - A Next.js Project

Welcome to **DeepSeek**, a project built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This guide will walk you through the steps to get started, understand the project, and deploy it.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/NumberGuessingGame.git
cd NumberGuessingGame/deepseek
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### Step 3: Run the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

### Step 4: Edit the Code

You can start editing the application by modifying the `app/page.js` file. The page will automatically update as you save your changes.

## Features
